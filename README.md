# Learning to Detect Violent Videos using Convolution LSTM

This work is based on violence detection model proposed by [1] with minor modications.
The original model was implemented with Pytorch [2] while in this work we implement it with Keras and TensorFlow as a back-end. 
The model incorporates pre-trained convolution Neural Network (CNN) connected to Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) layer.
The model takes as an inputs the raw video, converts it into frames and output a binary classication of violence or non-violence label.

## Running configurations
### Video datasets paths:
data path are defined as follows:
- hocky - data/raw_videos/HockeyFights
- violentflow - data/raw_videos/violentflow
- movies - data/raw_videos/movies

### Libraries perquisites:
- python 2.7
- numpy 1.14.0
- keras 2.2.0
- tensorflow 1.9.0
- Pillow 3.1.2
- opencv-python 3.4.1.15

### Running operation:
just run python run.py
(currently we don't support arguments from command line)
